        <div class="text-div">
            <p>A frog begins life as a fertilized egg. A female frog lays a lot of eggs at one time in a pond to increase the rate of survival. One female frog can lay thousands of eggs at once. The eggs float on water in a jelly mass or cluster.        </p>

        <h2>Tadpole Phase</h2>
       <div class="text-div">
            <p>When the tadpole hatches, it looks more like a fish than a frog. When tadpoles are first born they are little more than a mouth, gills and a tail. Inside their gut is the remainder of the jelly from their egg and this sustains them for the first few days of life. After about a week the tadpole will be strong enough to swim and search for food, which for the next few days of life, consists entirely of algae.</p>

        <div class="text-div">
            <p>During this time, the tadpole starts to develop lungs so it will be able to breathe out of the water when it becomes a frog. The tadpole also starts to grow two hind legs. Now it can leap around instead of only swimming. Although the tadpole is starting to look a little more like a frog, it still has a very long tail!</p>

        <div class="text-div">
            <p>Just before becoming a frog, the tadpole's gills disappear. The tadpole grows two front legs and its long tail becomes shorter and shorter. The tadpole uses the nutrients stored in its tail as food, so until its tail is completely gone, it doesn’t need anything else to eat! Then just a little stub of its tail is left, and the tadpole is a young frog. It hops right out of the water and onto dry land for the first time! The frog is still very small.</p>

        <h2>Life Cycle of a Frog</h2>
        <div class="text-div">
            <p>Frogs release a large number of eggs to make the chance of producing offspring greater. Fertilization happens outside of the female frog. That means that the chance of the eggs surviving is small. Other animals can eat the eggs or when the eggs aren’t getting any water they will dry up and die. By laying lots of eggs, it’s more likely that some will survive.</p>

            <p>The first reason for that is the fact that other animals see the eggs as food and gladly feast themselves on those eggs. This is why you won’t see much frogspawn in ponds with fish.</p>
            <p>The second reason is the fact that those eggs aren’t protected from the sun by anything. Normally, eggs have a strong layer of protection. Frogs don’t have that. This means that when the frog eggs aren’t laying in water, the sun will dry up those eggs and the tadpoles inside will die. Most frogs lay their eggs and attach them to submerging vegetation near the edge of the body of water.</p>
            <p>The survival rate of frog eggs that reach full maturity is very low. Female frogs lay between 2,000 and 10,000 eggs at one time, depending on the species of frog and environment. Only about 5 of these eggs will make it to full maturity in hopes of laying eggs themselves.</p>
